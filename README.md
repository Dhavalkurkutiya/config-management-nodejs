# Configuration Management in Node.js

## Overview

This repository demonstrates best practices for configuration management in Node.js applications. Configuration management is crucial for building scalable and maintainable applications, especially when deploying across multiple environments (development, testing, production).

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/config-management-nodejs.git
cd config-management-nodejs
npm install
```

## Usage

This project utilizes environment variables and configuration files to manage application settings. The configuration files are stored in the `config` directory and can be accessed based on the current environment (e.g., `development`, `production`).

### Running the Application

To run the application with a specific configuration, set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable:

```bash
NODE_ENV=development node app.js
```

## Environment Variables

The project relies on the following environment variables:

- `NODE_ENV`: Defines the environment (`development`, `production`, etc.).
- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run.
- `DB_HOST`: The database host.
- `DB_PORT`: The database port.
- `API_KEY`: The API key for external services.

You can manage these variables using a `.env` file at the root of your project. Here's an example `.env` file:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

## Configuration Files

Configuration files are stored in the `config` directory. The structure is as follows:

```plaintext
config/
├── default.json
├── development.json
├── production.json
└── test.json
```

- `default.json`: Default settings that apply to all environments.
- `development.json`: Settings specific to the development environment.
- `production.json`: Settings specific to the production environment.
- `test.json`: Settings specific to the test environment.

The `config` module automatically loads the correct configuration file based on the `NODE_ENV` variable.

## Best Practices

- **Environment-specific Configurations**: Separate configurations for different environments to avoid accidental deployment of development settings in production.
- **Sensitive Data**: Store sensitive information like API keys and database credentials in environment variables, not in source code.
- **Configuration Hierarchy**: Use a hierarchy of configuration files to allow for shared defaults and environment-specific overrides.

## Examples

This repository includes example usage of configuration management in different scenarios, such as:

- Connecting to a database.
- Setting up API endpoints.
- Managing third-party service integrations.
